# Hello there 👋 I'm Mathis

## 🤖 About me

I'm a French MEng student at [CentraleSupélec 🇫🇷](https://www.centralesupelec.fr/en) ([Paris-Saclay University](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), 12th in the [Shanghai Ranking](https://www.shanghairanking.com/rankings/arwu/2024) of world universities).

I'm currently working on exciting projects as a software engineer at [Paris Digital Lab](https://paris-digital-lab.com/), a gap year program where I'm prototyping multiple companies' most innovative projects! 🚀

During one year, I was member of [ViaRézo 🛜 ](https:///viarezo.fr/en/), France's largest student ISP & CP, operating 200+ servers and delivering a high-speed internet access to 2500+ clients.

I'm passionate about full-stack software development and currently learning cybersecurity to specialize in it during my final year of studies after a gap year.
